Use /remind to set a reminder for yourself, someone else, or for a channel. Some examples include:
• /remind me to drink water at 3pm every day

• /remind #team-alpha to "Update the project status today" every Monday at 9am
• /remind @jessica about the interview in 3 hours

You can also use /remind snooze [some description of time] in a direct message with Slackbot to request that a reminder be repeated later. For example:
